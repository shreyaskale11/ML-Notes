    "Recently, large-scale question answering datasets like the [Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) and [TriviaQA](http://nlp.cs.washington.edu/triviaqa/) have fueled much of the progress in this direction. By allowing researchers to train powerful and data-hungry deep learning models, these datasets have already enabled impressive results such as an algorithm that can answer many arbitrary questions by finding the appropriate answer in Wikipedia pages â€“ removing the need for a human to do all the hard work themselves.\n",
