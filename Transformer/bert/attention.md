The choice of dimensions for the query (Q), key (K), and value (V) vectors in the self-attention mechanism of a transformer model is a design decision that can have an impact on the model's performance. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and the choice of these dimensions depends on several factors, including the complexity of the task, the size of the dataset, and available computational resources. Here are some considerations for choosing these dimensions:

1. Model Complexity: The dimensions of Q, K, and V vectors are hyperparameters that determine the model's capacity to capture relationships in the data. Higher dimensions can potentially capture more complex patterns, but they also require more computational resources and data to train effectively. Lower dimensions may reduce model capacity but could be more computationally efficient.

2. Task Complexity: The choice of dimensions should be aligned with the complexity of the task you are trying to solve. For simpler tasks, you may not need high-dimensional vectors, while complex tasks may benefit from larger dimensions.

3. Dataset Size: The size of your training dataset can influence the choice of dimensions. If you have a small dataset, it may be challenging to train a model with very high-dimensional vectors due to overfitting. Conversely, larger datasets may allow for more complex models.

4. Pretrained Models: If you are using pretrained transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT), you may want to match the dimensions of your Q, K, and V vectors to those used in the pretrained model. This ensures compatibility and can facilitate transfer learning.

5. Computational Resources: Higher-dimensional vectors require more memory and computational power during training and inference. Consider the available hardware resources when selecting dimensions.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different dimensions as part of hyperparameter tuning. Grid search or random search can help identify the dimensions that work best for your specific task.

7. Trade-offs: There is often a trade-off between model capacity and computational efficiency. Smaller dimensions may make training faster but could limit the model's ability to capture intricate patterns. Larger dimensions may improve performance but come at the cost of increased resource requirements.

In practice, dimensions like 24 for both Q and K and 28 for V are not uncommon choices, but they are not fixed rules. The choice should be driven by empirical experimentation and consideration of the factors mentioned above. It's also worth noting that many transformer models use multi-head attention, where multiple sets of Q, K, and V matrices are used in parallel, further complicating the dimension choices but potentially improving performance.
